# Webmap-with-python
Webmap with base layer, polygon layer and marker layer made with python and folium

The following is code that creates a map using the python library, folium, that displays place names and interest points in Canada National parks.

Some data is being pulled from the site while some data has been downloaded so as to be accessed by the program.

The final map is saved in html format.
On the map, there are layers to select and deselect the number of points that should be visible on a map at any given time.






Future Work:
Eventually, it will be ideal to have all the data directly pulled directly from the site and only use the downloads as a back up.
